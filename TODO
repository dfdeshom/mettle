- support pipeline chaining
    - move pipeline done check to separate module
    - call that check from both timer and dispatcher
    - when a pipeline run is done, look for any other pipelines chained from it.
    - if you see any, then create the runs, lock_and_announce.
- Add 'target' to payload of job log messages.

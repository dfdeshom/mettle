When you're ready to release new changes, use the 'bumpversion' tool.  For
example:

    bumpversion patch

This will update setup.py with a new version number, and also create a new
Mercurial tag with that version number.  For bigger releases, you can also use
"bumpversion minor" and "bumpversion major".  Try to follow http://semver.org/.
